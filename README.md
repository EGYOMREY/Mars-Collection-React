# Mars Collection

Powered by React.
The motivation for this project came from my favorite one [Mars Collection](https://egyomrey.github.io/Mars-Collection/build/index.html) which I built with jQuery and ES6. I wanted to build this project using React, since it seems interesting to use.

# React Materialize

Used [React Materialize](https://react-materialize.github.io) to add styling
